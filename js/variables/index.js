// variables are containers that holds different values
let data = "hello"; // let is the variable declarator, data is the declared variable, hello is the value

// we have three key words that helps us ways in declaring a variable
var num = 22;
let person = "Emeka";
const ceo = "Jude";

// the difference between the three variable
// the "var" key word can be declared and reassigned
var word = "hey"; // word is declared and assigned a value
var word = "bye"; // word is redeclared and reassigned a value

// the "let" key word can only be declared once and reassigned a value
let greet = "welcome"; // declared greet and assigned a value
greet = "bye for now"; // the value of greet variable has been changed or reassigned

// the "const" the const key word is used to declare a constant. it can't be reassigned or redeclared
const isTrue = true; // the variable isTrue remains thesame through out the code
const numOne = 1;
